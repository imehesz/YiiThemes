=======

- Rearranged Menu Items more logical

- UserIdentity.php no longer needs to be copied

- Created WebUser class to tie in the cookie based user management features to the DB.

- Fixed some references to unset objects

- Changed directory permissions to 755 and file permissions to 644 so it works better with Git source control.>>>>>>> .r7
